# myFlix-client

## Objective

Using React, the client-side for an app called myFlix based on its
existing server-side code (REST API and database) is being built. 
The interface they’ll use when making requests to—and receiving responses from—the server-side is being created. The
client-side of the myFlix app includes several interface views (built using the React library) that will
handle data through the (previously defined) REST API endpoints.
